    "# 2015-06-19: Using ICA to Learn Color Opponent Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "*Last Updated*: 2020-11-29\n",

    "### Authors\n",
    "* Kevin Chu (kevin@velexi.com)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "In this Jupyter notebook, we demonstrate how color-opponent processing naturally arises as a way to decompose the RGB-based color space of natural scenes into statistically independent components. The Independent Component Analysis (ICA) algorithm is used to learn the statistically independent components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Independent Component Analysis (ICA) identifies a collection of components/signals that(1) are statistically independent and (2) can be mixed (i.e., linearly combined) to obtain the observed signals. Mathematically, ICA uses observations $\\{\\mathbf{x}_1, \\mathbf{x}_2, \\ldots\\}$ to estimate $m$ independent components $\\mathbf{A}_j$ (each an $n$ dimensional vector) that can be linearly combined to construct the observations:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "  \\mathbf{x}_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\mathbf{A}_j s_{ij}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $s_{ij}$ is the contribution of the $j$-th component to $\\mathbf{x}_i$. In matrix form, this relationship can be expressed as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\mathbf{x}_i = \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{s}_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{A}$ is the $n \\times m$ _mixing matrix_ consisting of the $m$ independent components $\\mathbf{A}_j$ as columns and $\\mathbf{s}_i$ is the vector formed from $s_{ij}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a particular observation $\\mathbf{x}_i$, the contribution of each component can be computed by (1) inverting $\\mathbf{A}$ if $\\mathbf{A}$ is square or (2) solving the least squares problem if $\\mathbf{A}$ is rectangular (with $m > n$).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Color Processing\n",
    "In the context of color processing, the _unmixing matrix_ (inverse of the mixing matrix) converts RGB values to three statistically independent components. The rows of this matrix define the computational processing that should be aplied to the raw RGB data to extract \"color values\" that are statistically independent. This example demonstrates that when applied to images from natural scenes, ICA indicates that RGB color values should be processed into \"opponent colors\" which is precisely how the human vision system processes raw color data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sensitivity of Results to Dataset Choice\n",
    "The color processing that is learned by ICA is sensitive to the choice of dataset. In particular, if the dataset is not representative of the colors that would be observed in the natural world, we should not expect that ICA would learn color opponent processing. Instead, ICA will learn a color processing scheme that yields statistically independent color values for the dataset used as input to the ICA algorithm.\n",
